              <?php _e("Iran is a land of history and culture, as everyone knows it's not a slogan- it is the origin of hand crafts and has more than two hundred types of art and crafts. Seven-Colored tiles (Seven as a symbol of Perfection, but not necessarily using 7 colors) –known as Haft Rang Tiles- are one of the most eye-catching parts of Iranian art which dates back to old centuries and can be found in most of ancient monuments as the signs of long-lasted civilization of this country that overwhelm all visitors by delicate colors. The drawing of tiles demonstrate variety and value of religious and spiritual heritage of Iranian ancestors which had been represented by Persian traditional artists and architectures. As a unique piece of art, based on individual tastes and wishes, blank tiles and adobe are drawn, matched in color and pattern demanded by customers, architectures and decorators, each totally hand-made tile fired in a special type of kilns and then will be glazed. So, producing tiles from classical to ultra-modern ones are what we are able to do. Also for painted dishes glazes are carefully applied with a brush resulting in timeless, distinctive and sophisticated works of art. What are hand-made tiles good for? Most of seven-colored tiles are inspired by classical designs that can express both sophistication and natural simplicity, but they can cover all discriminating tastes. You can bring artistic inspiration from cultures around the world to your projects. They can be used as a decoration or piece of historical art work and maybe as a durable and memorable souvenir of Persia. If you want many different variations of hue within a specific color for a beautiful and unique decoration it can be a good choice to be selected and won't be found elsewhere...", 'photosBlog') ?>

I studied Graphic as a student in school and University, it was my fate to choose Seven-Colored tiles as a B.A thesis which changed my life and I fell in love with this art. Painting tiles. Using lots of colors in graceful manner, being able to be a creator, to create enduring decorative objects, combining two main elements of nature (soil and fire) with a spectrum glazed colors and the last but the most to revere my country's past glory in art. All the blank tiles are painted (no matter which pattern or text) and then high-fired in special kilns. When I did so it makes me feel proud of transferring such simple materials to beautiful, memorable and unique hand-made tiles that can be touched by countless souls. As I wished to be an entrepreneurship so I gathered some artists women, we tried and succeed at it. We participated in different exhibitions to reflect what the women of our country are able to create (the list is below).
