Also for painted dishes glazes are carefully applied with a brush resulting in timeless, distinctive and sophisticated works of art. What are hand-made tiles good for? Most of seven-colored tiles are inspired by classical designs that can express both sophistication and natural simplicity, but they can cover all discriminating tastes. You can bring artistic inspiration from cultures around the world to your projects. They can be used as a decoration or piece of historical art work and maybe as a durable and memorable souvenir of Persia. If you want many different variations of hue within a specific color for a beautiful and unique decoration it can be a good choice to be selected and won't be found elsewhere..."
